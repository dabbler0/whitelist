# Whitelist
Minimalistic whitelist extension for Chrome. This should allow you to make requests only to certain domains. This can be used for various purposes, e.g for productivity or for increasing the performance of pages that make too many requests.

Some extensions like this exist already, but this kind of extension asks for a lot of permissions (intercept every http request!), so I thought it would be best for an extension like this to be open-source and as small as possible, so that if you are wondering what it does you can just read it in a few minutes. I'd like to try to keep the entirety of the source under maybe 200 lines and have no dependencies other than Chrome.
